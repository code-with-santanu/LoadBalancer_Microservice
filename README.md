<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/code-with-santanu/LoadBalancer_Microservice.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

```

3.  To run the project, use the following command:

```bash

```

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

The load balancer provides various endpoints for managing server cache and balancing web requests.

- The base URL for sending requests to the load balancer is:

```bash
 https://loadbalancer-microservice.onrender.com/lb
```

### Endpoints

1. Retrieve All Servers:
   _GET_ `/api/servers`

- Returns a list of all servers in the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _GET_ request :

```bash
 curl -X GET "https://loadbalancer-microservice.onrender.com/api/servers"
```

2. Add a Server:
   _POST_ `/api/servers`

- Add a new server to the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _POST_ request :

```bash
 curl -X POST "https://loadbalancer-microservice.onrender.com/api/servers" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "serverIp": "192.168.136.2",
  "port" : 8080,
  "maxWeight": 10,
  "serverUrl": "https://myserver.example.com"
}'
```

`NOTE:` Ensure to replace `{serverId}` with the actual server ID when making requests to the PUT and DELETE endpoints.

3. Update a Server:
   _PUT_ `/api/servers/{serverId}`

- Updates an existing server's information in the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _PUT_ request :

```bash
 curl -X PUT "https://loadbalancer-microservice.onrender.com/api/servers/server3" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "port" : 5050,
  "weight": 15
}'
```

4. Delete a Server:
   _DELETE_ `/api/servers/{serverId}`

- Deletes an existing server's information in the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _DELETE_ request :

```bash
 curl -X DELETE "https://loadbalancer-microservice.onrender.com/api/servers/{serverId}"

```
