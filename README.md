## About The Project

A server-side load-balancer for distributing the trafic among the web servers based on the selected server by using dynamic load balancing algorithm(Weighted Least Connections).<br>
For details implementation see üëâ [documentation](README)<br>

### Built With

- `Java` `Spring` `Spring Boot` `Hibernate`

<!-- FEATURES -->

## Features

- Dynamic load balancing algorithm for better efficiency .
- Secured endpoints to manage server-cache (add, update, delete server info) .
- Continuously monitored servers' health .
- Supported multithreading and concurrency for
  handling incoming web requests .
- Achieved containerization for scalability and
  portability .
- Deployed on cloud for real-time use .

<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

### <ins>Using Docker</ins> üëá :

1. Install Docker in your system (follow the link for Docker Desktop installation) :
   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. Pull the image from docker hub :

   ```bash
   docker pull santanupal/loadbalancer:latest
   ```

3. Run the docker image you pulled from docker hub :
   [`P.S`: Replace `<host-port>` by a port-no you want to run it ]

   ```bash
   docker run -it -d -p <host-port>:9000 santanupal/loadbalancer
   ```

4. You can see logs of the application. [`P.S`: Replace `<container-id>` by a port-no you want to run it ]:

   ```bash
   docker logs <container-id>
   ```

5. Now you are all set. [`P.S`: Replace `<host-port>` by port-no you used in step 3 ]<br>
   your base url will be `http://localhost:<host-port>`

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

The load balancer provides various endpoints for managing server cache and balancing web requests.

- The base URL for sending requests to the load balancer is:

```bash
 http://<yout-host-url>
```

### <ins>Endpoints</ins> üëá

üëâ <ins>endpoints To send request for balancing load</ins> : `/lb`

- example: `http://<your-host-url>/lb/myexample.com`

üëâ Other endpoints for managing server cache . . . . .

1. Retrieve All Servers:
   _GET_ `/api/servers`

- Returns a list of all servers in the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _GET_ request :

```bash
 curl -X GET "http://<your-host-url>/api/servers"
```

2. Add a Server:
   _POST_ `/api/servers`

- Add a new server to the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _POST_ request :

```bash
 curl -X POST "http://<your-host-url>/api/servers" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "serverIp": "192.168.136.2",
  "port" : 8080,
  "maxWeight": 10,
  "serverUrl": "https://myserver.example.com"
}'
```

`NOTE:` Ensure to replace `{serverId}` with the actual server ID when making requests to the PUT and DELETE endpoints.

3. Update a Server:
   _PUT_ `/api/servers/{serverId}`

- Updates an existing server's information in the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _PUT_ request :

```bash
 curl -X PUT "http://<your-host-url>/api/servers/{serverId}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "port" : 5050,
  "weight": 15
}'
```

4. Delete a Server:
   _DELETE_ `/api/servers/{serverId}`

- Deletes an existing server's information in the cache.
- For terminal usage, to make a _DELETE_ request :

```bash
 curl -X DELETE "http://<your-host-url>/api/servers/{serverId}"

```
